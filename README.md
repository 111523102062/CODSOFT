I am thrilled to join Codsoft for this fantastic internship opportunity! During this internship, I'll tackle three engaging projects that will enhance my web development skills:

Project 1: Landing Page: I'll create a visually appealing landing page, focusing on creativity and layout techniques. This project will help me practice arranging elements, creating columns, and ensuring a user-friendly design.

Project 2: Personal Portfolio: I'll develop a personal portfolio using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The portfolio will feature an engaging header, an about section, and contact information.

Project 3: Basic Calculator: I'll build an interactive calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will involve creating a user-friendly interface and handling various operations through programming logic.

I'm excited to apply my knowledge and creativity to these tasks and look forward to the valuable learning experience ahead!
